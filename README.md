# **SQTDT/SPDT :: Semiparametric Family-based Tests of Association**

We implement an efficient and reliable algorithm for the semiparametric family-based tests of association in the computer programs [SQTDT](http://dlin.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1568/2013/02/SQTDT.gz) and [SPDT](http://dlin.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1568/2013/02/SPDT.gz) for the Linux platform. A brief [documentation](http://dlin.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1568/2013/02/SQTDT_documentation.zip) is also available. We are currently developing user-friendly software for various platforms. If you would like to be notified upon its initial release, please send an email to \<gdiao\@gmu.edu\> including your name, email address, and institution.
